# Day 1 - ZK Intro


## Overview

- 40 yrs ago - started 1985
- practical only in last 5 years
- allows you to make claims on data without exposing the data
- anyone with proof and verify program can verify the claim
- Claim -> Prover -> Proof -> Prover is a program that takes claim data and generates proof
- Proof given to verifier -> verifier program can be used to verify the proof

## Properties
- Proof size is always smaller than claim
- Generating a proof takes a lot of time and resource intensive-> verifying is very fast
- One entity does heavy work and everyone else is very fast with minimal resources
- verified program is linked to prover program and is not generic
- how do you trust verifier program -> this is a big loophole...
- verifier is boolean- yes, proof is correct or no, proof is invalid
 

## why zk?

- data privacy and protection
- zk will be huge in 1-2 years
- eg. prove that you know A and B without showing A and B
- you send C = A * B -> C is public, A and B are private
- a verifier can verify you know some A and B by using a verifier program with proof and C
